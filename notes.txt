Check API if limited to 100 results / GET

Pokemon stats:
* most hp = 320
* highest dmg / atk = 300
* highest dmg / energy
* utility (abilities)


API uses 'lightning' instead of 'electric' for type... Have to manipulate this into 'electric'
API uses 'colorless' as a pokemon type because that card uses colorless resources.  must fix this
Could fix both these issues by making classNames for types and making custom css
