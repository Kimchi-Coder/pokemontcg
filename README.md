# Pokemon TCG Collection

## Built Using:

Built using create-react-app and the [Pokemon TCG API](https://pokemontcg.io)

## Goals:

1.  Add login capabilities with personal collections and decks
2.  Search any pokemon and add cards any collection and deck
3.  Filter search results and collections by various criteria (type, series, hp, rarity, etc.)
4.  Share collections and decks with other users

## Things I'm learning:

1.  Cleanly consuming an API while avoiding unnecessary re-renders
2.  Caching search results to improve performance and prevent unnecessary requests to API
3.  OAuth
4.  Better project structure and scoping of components and css. (Still need to improve classNames)

## To-do:

[x] Fix routing: entering specific /card/set/num route doesn't fetch

[ ] Fix out of range errors for routes - errorboundary?

[ ] Add users

[ ] Add collections

[ ] Add graph of pokemon card power

[ ] Add pricing api for individual cards

[ ] Add a sets view

[ ] Change Search filters to searched card filters and add search filters allowing a search without a name and only type/series
